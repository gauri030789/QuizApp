Quiz App - README Project Overview This project is a Quiz Application built using React.js. The app allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, track their score, and view a summary at the end of the quiz. The quiz data is fetched from an external API, and fallback static data is provided in case of any issues with the API.

Features Question Navigation: Users can navigate through the quiz questions. Score Tracking: The app keeps track of the user's score as they answer questions correctly. Timer: Each question is timed (30 seconds). Progress Bar: The app shows the userâ€™s progress as they complete the quiz. End of Quiz Summary: After completing the quiz, the user sees a summary of their score. Loading State: A loading screen is shown while fetching the quiz data. Error Handling: If the API fetch fails, fallback static data is used. Tech Stack React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Axios: Library for making HTTP requests to fetch quiz data. CSS: For styling the app and providing a clean and simple interface. Setup Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:
